# newAbarth


This project is a single-page application using front-end only. This is built to allow the client to view information about the new Abarth model ‘Competizione’. 

The project was built to practice working with HTML, JS, jQuery DOM Manipulation and CSS, within the front-end. Leaflet.js - a map framework was also used to display dealerships within the UK.

An eye catching feature is the ‘3D-model’ configurator, allowing the user to select a paint colour and then navigate an interactive model. Due to hosting restrictions and GLB files not being supported, this was later changed to image files. To view all 3D models see the ‘assets’ folder.

<h2>Usage</h2>
This application does not use any server side technologies. The user can download this through the link above the repo.

<h2>Features</h2>
Upon loading of the application, the user can navigate through a ‘mega-menu’ style nav bar. The links intentionally do not work. Also featured in the navigation is several other buttons and a sign-in feature. 

<h3>Carousel</h3>
A carousel also appears displaying information about the new car.

<h2>Future Development</h2> 
To improve this project, and to improve its functionality, further research needs to be done into the hosting issue of Google’s model viewer. This aspect makes the site interactive thus is a great loss without this.

An implementation of back-end features such as allowing the user to register would be effective. In addition to this, the development of other model pages would further increase the functionality of the site.

Another improvement which would be rectified if this was put into development publically, could be to clean up the styling and to improve the mobile appearance.
